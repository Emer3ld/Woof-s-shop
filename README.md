 How To Your IDE

To begin creating your app, choose either Visual Studio Code or Android Studio as your preferred IDE. For this particular app, I used Android Studio. You will also need to install Flutter, which you can do by following the links provided. It is important to include plugins, with Dart being the most crucial one (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) .

To install the Flutter SDK, visit the website and follow the specific instructions for your operating system. Next, download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the official website (https://developer.android.com/studio)  or through JetBrains toolbox, which offers better version control.

Once Android Studio is installed, you can easily install Flutter via the marketplace. Simply open Android Studio, go to File -> Settings -> Plugins and click on the Marketplace tab. Search for "Flutter" and install the plugin by clicking on the Install button. Now, you can create a new Flutter project by going to File -> New -> New Flutter Project and starting your project.
